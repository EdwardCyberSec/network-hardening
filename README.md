<h1>Network Hardening</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this task, I was asked to review the following scenario and write up a security risk assessment report to throw light on the incident and suggest ways to further secure the network:

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
1.	The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2.	The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3.	The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4.	Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 
In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

The report should include answers to the following:
Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement
Part 2: Explain your recommendation(s)

<br />


<h2>Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement</h2>
Three essential hardening tools that the organization can employ to address the identified vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. Some MFA options include a password, pin number, badge, one-time password (OTP) sent to a cell phone, and fingerprint.

2. Strong password policies
Password policies can be used to include rules like password length, a
list of acceptable characters, and a disclaimer to discourage password sharing.
They can also include rules surrounding unsuccessful login attempts, such as
the lose user access to the network after five unsuccessful attempts.

3. Firewall maintenance
A firewall maintenance includes checking and updating security configurations to ensure the system stays on top of potential threats

By employing these hardening measures, the organization can significantly enhance its cybersecurity posture and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.

<h2>Explain your recommendation(s)</h2>

Using MFA can be used to make sure that verified users have access to the system or networks. This is a good way of mitigating the risk of an attack, since it relies on two or more ways of authentication. It will also make it hard for employees to share passwords within the organization. 

Having and enforcing strong password policies can prevent malicious threat actors from accessing the network by making it more difficult to guess. These policies should be regularly updated so that it increases user security within the organization. 

Regular maintenance of the firewall is of utmost importance. Keeping the firewall rules up-to-date, especially after any security event that allows suspicious network traffic, provides robust defense against various DoS and DDoS attacks. Ensuring the firewall's integrity through routine checks and updates is vital for safeguarding the network's overall security.
